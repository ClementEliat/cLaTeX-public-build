### /!\ WARNINGS /!\ ###
- MacOS users : This script needs gdate (coreutils) to be installed to work properly.
- Compatibility without gdate will be investigated soon.
- The overall compatibility of this script has not been extensively tested yet.
- Before using -o options, open the source code and replace **"My pdf opening command"** on **line 48** by your favourite command to open a pdf file and remove the # character (comment in *bash*). I am working on doing this automatically by scanning the system or something like this to match a proper command. THank you for your understanding.
